# Prioritize keeping the git history clean and maintainable. Use common sense.
#
# Template:
#
#     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
#     <body>
#
#     <footer>
#
# The HEADER is the first line. Keep it short and sweet. It contains:
# - Type    : the kind of commit.
# - Scope   : the area of code touched by the commit. This is optional.
# - Subject : a short description for the commit. Follow these guidelines:
#   - imperative; present tense
#   - lowercase first letter
#   - no dot at the end
# The BODY is a longer description for the commit. Include motivation,
# previous behavior, and other relevant information.
# The FOOTER includes BREAKING CHANGE warnings, GitHub issue references,
# and other code-like information.
#
# Common Types:
# - feat     : adds a feature
# - fix      : fixes a bug
# - refactor : cleans code without changing behavior
# - chore    : maintaienances (dependencies, copyright)
# - perf     : improves performance
# - style    : improves code style (whitespace, formatting)
# - build    : project build logic
# - lang     : user-facing language
# - docs     : programmer documentation (Javadocs, README, etc)
# - test     : modifies tests
